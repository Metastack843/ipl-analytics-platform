# 🏏 IPL Fan Engagement & Performance Analytics Platform

A comprehensive analytics system designed to uncover insights into player consistency, team strategy, and fan engagement drivers in the Indian Premier League (IPL).

## 🚀 Project Overview

**Goal:** Build an end-to-end intelligence platform that answers:

- Who are the most consistent high-impact players?
- Which teams drive the highest fan engagement?
- Does home advantage play a significant role?

The system processes raw ball-by-ball data into enriched datasets ready for BI tools (Power BI, Tableau, Streamlit).

## 🛠️ Data Pipeline & Logic

### 1. Data Cleaning (`01_data_cleaning.ipynb`)

- **Standardization**: Unifies team names (e.g., _Delhi Daredevils_ → _Delhi Capitals_).
- **Derivation**: Creates binary `is_wicket` column from dismissal types.
- **Filtering**: Removes abandoned matches and Super Overs for accurate stats.

### 2. Feature Engineering (`02_feature_engineering.ipynb`)

#### **Key Metrics Implemented**

- **Consistency Index** (Player Level):
  $$ \text{Consistency Index} = \frac{\text{Avg Runs per Match}}{\text{Std Dev of Runs}} $$
  _Higher is better. Identifies reliable anchors vs. volatile hitters._

- **Match Intensity Score** (Team/Match Level - Fan Engagement Proxy):
  $$ \text{Intensity} = \text{Total Runs} + (\text{Wickets} \times 20) + (\text{Boundaries} \times 5) $$
  _Quantifies the excitement level of a match._

- **Team Performance**:
  - Win Rate (%)
  - Home vs. Away Win % (Enriched with venue data)

## 📊 Analytical Layers

### **SQL Layer (DuckDB)**

Used for rapid business intelligence queries.

- **Box Office Kings**: categorizes teams based on Win Rate vs. Intensity.
- **Toss Bias**: Validates the impact of winning the toss on match outcomes.

### **R Statistical Layer**

Used for advanced validation.

- **T-Tests**: Confirms if "High Consistency" players actually have better batting averages.
- **ANOVA**: Tests if specific venues significantly increase match intensity (e.g., Chinnaswamy Stadium effect).
- **Clustering**: K-Means analysis to segment players into profiles (Anchors, Finishers, etc.).

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Setup Environment**:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
   pip install pandas numpy duckdb openpyxl
   ```

2. **Run Pipeline**:
   - Execute `notebooks/01_data_cleaning.ipynb`
   - Execute `notebooks/02_feature_engineering.ipynb`

3. **Run Analysis**:
   - **SQL**: `python sql/load_db.py` (Creates `ipl_analytics.duckdb`)
   - **R**: Run `r_analysis/statistical_analysis.R` in RStudio or via Rscript.
